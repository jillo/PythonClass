Guessing Game Program

# This program generates a random number and gives the user as many 
# tries as it takes to guess the number (and tracks this number), giving 
# the user feedback on their guesses to help them get closer and 
# eventually guess the number.


psuedocode:

# Create a variable to control the loop.
keep going = 'y'

# Start the guessing game with the user
while keep going == 'y':

	number = (call the random number function)

	Ask the player to guess the number using whole numbers only
	
	guess = int(input("guess the number"))

	while guess != number:

		start the counter 

		if guess < number
			if guess >= number-10
				print getting warm but still low
			else 
				print("too low!")

		else 
			if guess <= number+10
				print getting warm but still high
			else 
				print("too high!")
				
		guess = int(input("guess again!"))
			

	#(if guess = number)(not sure this is needed)

	print congrats statement with # of tries in the statement
	ask if they want to play again (y or n)
	Keep going = input ("play again? Y for yes")
	

Output/print statements:

I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 1000.  Guess what 
number I am thinking of!

Too high!

Too low!

Getting warm but still high

Congratulations!  It only took you X tries to guess the number!

Would you like to play again?
