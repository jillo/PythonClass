OMG THIS IS SO FUCKING CONFUSING
WHICH COMBINATION OF WHILE/FOR OR IF/ELSE SHOULD THIS USE????


get input
	if input is invalid
		add 1 to the counter (limit is x)
		tell em they have x-1 more tries
		
		#the for loop won't work here because it has to do something between each loop
		#unless the for loop could just be for the counter?
		
		while tries < x
			add 1 to the accumulator
			message to give input again


		
		if counter has reached x
			end program  #(but how?!?!  cuz i'm inside a while loop! need a sentinel)
			
		
		else
			get input again
	
	else
		do conversion and ask for the next item
		
		
	
	
	
while another to input
	get input
		if valid
			do conversion
